The visual on the **Race / Category tab on the right** shows the racial distribution in all graduate programs using IPEDS race / category definitions. **Visuals on the left**, show the distribution of the different ethnicities / backgrounds that fall under each race / category. 

**Students are counted in every race/ethnicity group in which they have self-identified; therefore, the race/ethnicity percentages may exceed 100%.**
