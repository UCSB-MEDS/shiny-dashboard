Two classification systems are commonly used to report race and ethnicity data: **URM** and **IPEDS**.

- **URM (Underrepresented Minority)** refers to U.S. citizens who identify as Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, or American Indian. Individuals who identify with multiple races are still considered URM if at least one of those identities falls within a URM category.

- **IPEDS (Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System)**  uses a two-step process: first, individuals indicate whether they are "Hispanic or Latino" or "Not Hispanic or Latino". Second, they may select one or more of the following racial categories: American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and White. Full definitions of these categories are available on the <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/report-your-data/race-ethnicity-definitions" target="_blank">IPEDS website.</a>

***For all race/ethnicity plots below: Students are counted in every race / ethnicity group with which they self-identify. As a result, total percentages may exceed 100%.***
