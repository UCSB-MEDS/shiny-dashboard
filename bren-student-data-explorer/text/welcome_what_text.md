This interactive data explorer was built to visualize admissions and career outcome data of current students and recent graduates. It includes demographics of all Bren students and career outcomes for master's students (MEDS & MESM).

We developed this explorer with the intention of supporting:

-   Prospective students in their decision-making as they explore different Bren School degree programs ( <a href="https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science" target="_blank"><img src="logos/bren_meds_hex.png" alt="MEDS hex in blue-green" class="meds_hex"/></a> <a href="https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-science-and-management" target="_blank"><img src="logos/bren_mesm_hex.png" alt="MESM hex in dark-blue" class="mesm_hex"/></a> <a href="https://bren.ucsb.edu/phd-environmental-science-and-management" target="_blank"><img src="logos/bren_phd_hex.png" alt="PhD hex in light-green" class="phd_hex"/></a> )
-   Bren staff across all units to offer relevant information for strategic planning and reporting requirements
-   All Bren communities and stakeholders from past, present, and future by creating data transparency and data integrity through an accessible application
