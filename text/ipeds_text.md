There are two definitions used when reporting on race and ethnicity: URM and IPEDS. 

1. **URM (Underrepresented Minority)** is defined as a U.S. citizen who identifies as Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, or American Indian. If a person identifies as multiple races and one of the groups they selected is a URM, they will get reported with that URM status.

2. The **Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS)** first designates ethnicity as Hispanic or Latino or Not Hispanic or Latino. Second, a person will indicate one or more of the following racial categories: American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, White. Definitions for these categories can be found on the <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/report-your-data/race-ethnicity-definitions" target="_blank">IPEDS website.</a>

**For ALL Race / Category plots: Students are counted in every race/ethnicity group in which they have self-identified; therefore, the race/ethnicity percentages may exceed 100%.**
